# Push the tempo 🔊

### My first react app 🎉

A small game in which you tap to a given BPM (beats per minute).

This was a nice exercize in using hooks and react-router. Coming from 4 years of exclusively developing Angular not everything made sense from the start. 🤷‍♂️
The lifecycle events and the `useEffect()` hook are still something that I'll need to get the hang of. 📚

run `npm start` to see the application, or go to https://tomasklingen.com/push-the-tempo.

The UI is kind of hacked together. I hope you can tell I'm not a designer.
